<h2>Viewing Finds</h2>

<p>If you'd like to view your finds, touch the "View Finds" button on the POSIT home screen. To view a find, simply touch it in the list - now you can continue to view or further edit your find.</p>

<p>You may also view your finds on a map according to their automatically recorded GPS positions. Simply press your Android phone's menu button to open the widget drawer and touch the map button. You may use the zoom-in and zoom-out buttons at the bottom of your screen to adjust the map.</p>
