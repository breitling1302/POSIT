<h1>Welcome to POSIT!</h1>
<p>POSIT (Portable Open Search and Identification Tool) lets you collect and 
share 'finds', which can be any item you want to search for and catalog. 
POSIT timestamps, geostamps and lets you associate photos and text with 
your finds, which can then be synced with an online server and shared with 
other POSIT users.</p>
<h2>What is a "find"?</h2>
<p>A <b>find</b> is anything that a user has located and would like to catalog 
using POSIT. A <b>find</b> can be any item of interest from a cool beer pub, 
an invasive species, a supermarket product, or a structure damaged by natural disaster.</p>
