=== Version 0.6 Alpha ===

New Features

    * RWG performance is more robust and it has an improved user interface.  In RWG mode an icon appears in the notification bar. The UI provides 
notification when Finds are received in ad-hoc mode (vibrates, lights up, sound).
    * Synchronization is now down in a separate thread and is a bit faster.
    * Coverage Tracker runs in a separate thread and can run in the background while using other POSIT and phone features. 
    * Positweb contains addition features to display projects, finds, maps, coverage tracks.

Resolved Issues

    * Projects menu is now scrollable and indicates which project you currently have selected.
    * Projects menu is no longer populated with duplicate entries when you resume POSIT after leaving the application.
    * The Finds display truncates long names and descriptions.
    * Find IDs are now represented as strings and no longer fail for long numbers.

Known Issues

    * RWG occasionally hangs on start up because of an unresolved buffer issue.  The workaround is to restart POSIT and/or the phone itself if start 
up takes more than 2 minutes.
    * The synchronization module downloads duplicate copies of photos usually on the first time the phone is synched with the server.
    * RWG still requires a rooted dev phone with a  non-standard kernel.  It currently does not run on Android 2.1.  
    * Finds that have IDs containing letters are not correctly reported as synced.
