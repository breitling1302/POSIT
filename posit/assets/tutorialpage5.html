<h2>Tracking Your Itinerary</h2>

<p>To use the <i><b>Coverage Tracker</b></i> from the main menu you must have GPS
enabled. It works best if you also have NETWORK access through WiFi or Mobile.
</p>

<p>Pressing <i><b>Start</b></i> will create a new <b>Expedition</b>, sending your 
points to the POSIT server while storing them on the phone. After you <i><b>Stop</b></i>
tracking, you can save your expedition.  Use the <i><b>List</b></i> button to view
previously saved tracks.
</p>

<p>If network connectivity is lost, Tracker will cache the points on the phone 
for later transmission.  <font color=Red>Known issue: </font> The responsiveness
of the user interface degrades when too many points are cached.  We're working on 
it.
