<h2>Adding Finds</h2>
<p>Once you have located the find that you'd like to catalog, touch the "Add Find" button on the POSIT home screen. Next, simply touch the text-input box that reads "title" and enter a title. You may enter a description in the same manner. In addition, POSIT will automatically capture GPS data for your find.</p>
<p>To record an image of your find, simply touch the camera button, position your phone accordingly, and click the capture button. If you are satisfied, touch the "Okay" button to proceed; otherwise, you may retake your photo by touching the "Retake" button.</p> 
<p>Touching the save button will save your find into the phone's database.</p>
