About
====

Portable Open Search and Identification Tool (POSIT) is a Humanitarian Free and
Open Source Software project (http://www.hfoss.org) , to use the Google Android 
phone as a platform for mobile disaster management applications. POSIT (Portable 
Open Search and Identification Tool) is an extensible and configurable Android 
prototype currently running on the G1 phone provided by T-Mobile. It is configured 
to serve as a portable search and rescue tool, using the phone's GPS, camera, 
database, and touchscreen interface to collect and save data about disaster victims
 and transmit the data periodically to a remote server using either an Internet or 
 cellular protocol. POSIT demonstrates that the free and open Android platform is 
 an accessible platform for rapid application development of disaster management 
 applications on mobile phones.
